# LayoutLM vs Llama 3.2 Vision 11B vs InternVL: NER Invoice Processing Methodology Comparison

## Executive Summary

This document provides a comprehensive comparison between LayoutLM, Llama 3.2 Vision 11B, and InternVL for Named Entity Recognition (NER) in invoice processing applications. These three approaches represent different paradigms in multimodal document understanding, each with distinct strengths and limitations for enterprise invoice automation.

## Overview of Approaches

### LayoutLM Methodology
LayoutLM (Layout Language Model) is a specialized multimodal transformer designed specifically for document understanding tasks. It processes documents through a structured OCR-first approach, combining textual content with spatial layout information.

### Llama 3.2 Vision 11B Methodology
Llama 3.2 Vision 11B is a general-purpose multimodal large language model that processes documents as images, leveraging vision-language understanding to extract entities through natural language generation.

### InternVL Methodology
InternVL is a large-scale vision-language foundation model that follows the "ViT-MLP-LLM" architecture, combining a powerful vision encoder (InternViT-6B) with large language models through progressive alignment training. It excels in document understanding, OCR, and multimodal reasoning tasks.

## Multi-Document Processing Considerations

### Complex Document Scenarios
Real-world invoice processing often involves challenging scenarios that require specialized handling:

- **Multiple Invoices per Image**: Single scanned page containing 2-4 separate invoices
- **Stapled Documents**: Primary invoice with attached receipts, supporting documentation
- **Multi-page Documents**: Invoice spanning multiple pages with continuation sheets
- **Mixed Document Types**: Invoice packets containing receipts, delivery notes, purchase orders
- **Overlapping Content**: Documents with overlapping or partially obscured text

    def process_multi_invoice_image(self, image):
        # 1. Document segmentation using computer vision
        document_regions = self.segment_documents(image)
        
        # 2. OCR each document region separately
        ocr_results = []
        for region in document_regions:
            ocr_data = self.ocr_engine.extract(region)
            ocr_results.append(ocr_data)
        
        # 3. Process each document with LayoutLM
        all_entities = []
        for i, ocr_data in enumerate(ocr_results):
            entities = self.layoutlm.predict(
                words=ocr_data['words'],
                boxes=ocr_data['boxes'],
                image=document_regions[i]
            )
            # Add document ID to each entity
            for entity in entities:
                entity['document_id'] = i
                entity['document_type'] = self.classify_document(entities)

- Additional preprocessing complexity

#### Llama 3.2 Vision Multi-Document Handling
```python
class LlamaVisionMultiDocProcessor:
    def process_multi_invoice_image(self, image):
        # 1. Create multi-document aware prompt
        prompt = self.create_multi_document_prompt()
        
        # 2. Single pass processing with document awareness
        response = self.model.generate(
            images=image,
            text=prompt,
            max_new_tokens=1024  # Increased for multiple documents
        )
        
        # 3. Parse structured response with document separation
        documents = self.parse_multi_document_response(response)
        
        # 4. Validate document relationships
        documents = self.validate_document_relationships(documents)
        
        return documents
    
    def create_multi_document_prompt(self):
        return """
        This image may contain multiple documents (invoices, receipts, etc.).
        
        For each document found, extract entities and return JSON:
        {
          "documents": [
            {
              "document_id": 1,
              "document_type": "invoice|receipt|statement",
              "document_position": "top-left|top-right|bottom-left|bottom-right|center",
              "entities": [...],
              "relationships": ["stapled_to_doc_2", "supports_doc_1"]
            }
          ]
        }
        
        Important:
        - Identify spatial relationships between documents
        - Determine if documents are related (invoice + receipt)

        # 2. Process tiles with spatial context
        tile_results = []
        for tile in tiles:
            tile_entities = self.internvl.extract_with_context(
                tile=tile,
                spatial_position=tile.position,
                neighboring_tiles=tile.neighbors
            )
            tile_results.append(tile_entities)
        
        # 3. Merge and deduplicate across tiles
        merged_entities = self.spatial_merge(tile_results)
        
        # 4. Document clustering based on spatial proximity
        documents = self.cluster_entities_by_document(merged_entities)
        
        # 5. Relationship analysis
        documents = self.analyze_document_relationships(documents)
        
        return documents
    
    def spatial_merge(self, tile_results):
        """Merge entities across tiles using spatial overlap detection"""
        merged = []
        for tile_result in tile_results:
            for entity in tile_result:
                # Check for spatial overlap with existing entities
                if not self.has_spatial_overlap(entity, merged):
                    merged.append(entity)
                else:
                    # Merge with existing entity (higher confidence wins)
                    self.merge_overlapping_entity(entity, merged)
        return merged
```
