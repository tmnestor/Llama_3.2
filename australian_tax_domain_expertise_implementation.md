2. **Classification System**: Australian tax classifier provides document type detection
3. **Confidence Assessment**: Australian tax confidence scorer provides quality assessment
4. **Prompt System**: Australian tax prompts provide domain-specific extraction

### Usage Flow

```python
# 1. Classify document
classification_result = classify_australian_tax_document(text)

# 2. Extract fields using appropriate prompt
prompt = get_document_extraction_prompt(classification_result.document_type)
extracted_fields = extract_with_prompt(text, prompt)

# 3. Assess ATO compliance
ato_result = assess_ato_compliance_enhanced(
    extracted_fields, 
    classification_result.document_type.value
)

# 4. Score confidence
confidence_result = score_australian_tax_document_processing(
    text, classification_result, extracted_fields, ato_result
)
```
