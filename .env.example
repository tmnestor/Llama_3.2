# PERFORMANCE OPTIMIZATION NOTES:
# 
# Key changes from default settings:
# - MAX_TOKENS: 1024 → 256 (receipts don't need 1000+ tokens)
# - DO_SAMPLE: true → false (deterministic generation is faster)
# - TEMPERATURE: 0.3 → 0.1 (more focused responses)
# - TOP_P: 0.95 → 0.8 (reduced sampling space)
# - TOP_K: 50 → 20 (fewer top candidates)
# - MEMORY_CLEANUP_ENABLED: true → false (unnecessary for single images)
#
# Expected results:
# - Speed: 46 seconds → 5-10 seconds per image
# - Extraction: 4 fields → 15+ fields extracted
# - Quality: Clean responses without repetition artifacts
